# Getting Started

I decided to make the second version of my personal website with Deno, my new favorite Typescript and JavaScript runtime. 

The big tech decision I made was to use the Lume SSG instead of Aleph.js, Fresh, or Ultra.js. Each was tempting for their own reasons, but Lume ended up working out the best because of my familiarity with SSGs. 

## Planning the website

A lot of research went into what technology I would use. However, I kind of designed it on the fly. There were no designs for Figma or anything, which I know is bad. Don't copy me!

I kind of changed it a lot during the development process, which really isn't very fun. I guess that's what I get for no designing phase or anything.

## Planning Out Pages and Content

Again, not a lot of planning here, but I did manage to make a website I really liked with the pages I think I needed.

This site is much more thorough than my last portfolio. I'm pretty proud of the work I did. Now, let's get into the technical side of things!
