# Andrew Weisbeck Technical Docs Intro

Learn how I have created my most important personal projects! This site was created to be a separate knowledge source for myself and others so you can learn how I built my own projects. My motivation for this was to have a place to keep detailed documentation, separate from my personal website and my other notes for JavaScript, etc. I also wanted to be able to use Docusaurus because I love this static site generator!

## Getting Started

You can select any project you want from the left hand sidebar. If you don't feel like jumping into a project quite yet, check out [the blog](https://andrewweisbeck.tech/blog). Have a question? Feel free to contact me with [the contact form here](https://andrewweisbeck.tech/contact).

### This site was made with

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) version 2

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
